Titles that overflow from the card on the homepage will scroll responsively depending on the title length when hovering over using CSS3
(Hover over long titles with mouse and the title will scroll based on it's size)

Login and signup page (form pages) are not individual pages but instead modal. Using javascript and CSS3.
(Click on sign up/log in buttons on index.html to bring up these forms)

Arrow sliders on homepage would (probably) require a movie database to function properly. 
Instead I linked clicking them to running a javascript function to prove the concept.

Designed with mobile compatibility in mind, less movies show per row on smaller screens, arrow sliders disappear on smaller screens login and signup
buttons become detached to just under the navbar on particularly small screens (using CSS3 media tags).

Design roughly follows inital sketchups, with improvements made along the way to the design.

Uses FontAwesome, JQuery, Material Design Bootstrap and Bootstrap 4 as libraries/imports.

Dashboard and table page are merged into one page, the admin page.

Star icon from font-awesome, all other icons are from https://material.io/resources/icons/ (including favicon)

Uses labels and semantic tags. (Apart from section tag, uses div instead)

Checked for compatibility with many browsers. Works on Firefox, Opera, Chrome, Chromium, Chrome Canary, Brave Browser. 
Will not work as intended on Internet Explorer. Couldn't test on Safari or Edge (I use Windows 7).
